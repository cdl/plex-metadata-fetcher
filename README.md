# plex-metadata-fetcher :clapper::sparkles:

A script intended to be used with [Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php) to organize a Plex
library. Takes in a file name as an argument, and queries [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org)
/ [The TV DB](http://thetvdb.com/) in order to get metadata information for that file.

***

This script is hella unfinished right now. I'll tag a release once it's in a working state.
